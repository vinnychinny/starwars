             <p>On Tatooine, C-3PO and R2-D2 deliver a message from Luke to Jabba: Luke wants to strike a deal for Han's release, and he's giving the droids to Jabba as a gift to establish good will. Jabba laughs off Luke's attempt at bargaining, but takes C-3PO as his new translator droid and gives R2-D2 a gig serving cocktails on his sail barge.</p> <br>
            
            <p>A bounty hunter shows up at Jabba's palace with Chewbacca, demanding payment, and makes a deal with Jabba. Later that night, the bounty hunter frees Han and reveals herself to be Princess Leia Organa. Before Han and Leia can escape, they're captured by Jabba. Leia's made Jabba's slave; Han's tossed in a cell with Chewbacca.</p>

            <p>Here comes Luke.</p> <br>

            <p>He tries one last time to make a deal with Jabba for the release of his pals, but Jabba isn't having it. Luke is thrown to the rancor, a nasty dungeon monster, but ultimately defeats the toothy beast. Jabba's not happy. He sentences Luke, Han, and Chewbacca to death by sarlacc—another nasty monster—at the Pit of Carkoon. Meanwhile, Lando Calrissian hangs out undercover as one of Jabba's goons.</p> <br>

            <p>The whole entourage heads for The Pit of Carkoon on Jabba's sail barge. Just as Luke's about to walk the plank, pirate style, into the pit, he starts a mutiny. Luke, Leia, Han, Chewbacca, and Lando fight back against Jabba and his henchmen, ultimately blowing up the sail barge and escaping. </p>

           <p>Luke makes a pit stop in Dagobah on his way to join the Rebels. He visits Yoda, who confirms that Darth Vader is his deadbeat dad. Then Yoda tells Luke that Leia is his twin sister, and Luke has to face Vader in order to become a full-fledged, card-carrying Jedi knight.</p> <br>

            <p>On Endor, Luke and Leia fend off Imperial stormtroopers on speeder bikes. Leia is momentarily MIA after falling off her speeder bike in the forest. Then Luke, Han, Leia and their whole motley crew meet the locals, the Ewoks, a furry race of primitive creatures who look like teddy bears and think C-3PO is a god. The Rebels and the Ewoks join forces.</p> <br>

<p>Luke tells Leia that they're twins, and then he surrenders to Darth Vader. Luke tells Vader that he knows there's still good in his dear old dad, but Vader still delivers Luke to The Emperor. </p> <br>
            <p>Luke and Darth Vader engage in an epic lightsaber battle that culminates in Luke chopping off Vader's robotic right hand. The Emperor congratulates Luke on finally embracing his hatred. Luke says he'll never, ever join the Dark Side, and The Emperor's super ticked off. Meanwhile, on Endor, the Rebel-Ewok alliance takes down the Imperial forces. Then they blow up the Death Star's defense shield.</p>

           <p>The Emperor and Luke go toe to toe. The Emperor repeatedly zaps Luke with Force Lightning like a demented wizard. Darth Vader just watches at first, as Luke writhes in pain, but finally Vader has enough. He picks up The Emperor, who electrocutes him, too, and chucks The Emperor into a nearby reactor shaft.</p> <br>

<p>The Emperor explodes.</p>

Luke joins the party on Endor with Han, Leia, Chewbacca, the droids, the Ewoks, and assorted Rebels. He steps away for a moment and spots the smiling spirits of Yoda, Obi-Wan, and his dad.</p> <br>

<p>He smiles back, then returns to the party.</p>
